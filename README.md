----------
To create an AI Voicebot that automates hotel room availability inquiries and follow-up processes, we need to integrate multiple components, including voice recognition, telephony systems, Natural Language Processing (NLP), API integrations, and post-call follow-ups. Below is a Python-based outline and code for this voicebot system, utilizing Twilio for making calls, Google Cloud Speech-to-Text for speech recognition, and GPT-based AI models for understanding queries.
Key Components:

    Voicebot Functionality: Handle calls to check hotel room availability and follow-up processes.
    Twilio Integration: Manage voice calls using India-based numbers.
    NLP (Natural Language Processing): Understand spoken language in multiple languages (English, Hindi, etc.).
    API Integration: Sync data related to room availability, bookings, and follow-ups.
    Post-Check-in/Check-out Follow-ups: Automate calls to confirm guest satisfaction and feedback collection.

Project Requirements Breakdown:

    Telephony: Twilio (with support for India-based numbers).
    Speech Recognition: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text or an alternative AI-powered speech-to-text API.
    NLP for Understanding Queries: ChatGPT or similar AI for interpreting hotel staff responses.
    Backend: Python with Flask or FastAPI.
    Database: For storing room availability, guest information, and feedback.

Step 1: Setup Requirements

    Install Required Libraries:

pip install twilio google-cloud-speech Flask openai requests

    Setup Twilio: Sign up for Twilio and get an India-based phone number.

    Google Cloud Speech-to-Text: Set up Google Cloud and enable the Speech-to-Text API to transcribe the calls.

    OpenAI API: Get an API key from OpenAI for integrating GPT for conversational responses.

Step 2: Create the AI Voicebot Using Twilio, Speech-to-Text, and GPT
1. Flask App (app.py):

This will manage the Flask web app and handle incoming and outgoing calls.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse
from twilio.rest import Client
import os
import openai
from google.cloud import speech
from io import BytesIO

# Initialize Flask app
app = Flask(__name__)

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Twilio credentials
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = 'your_account_sid'
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = 'your_auth_token'
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = 'your_twilio_phone_number'

# Initialize Twilio Client
client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# Google Cloud Speech API setup
speech_client = speech.SpeechClient()

# Route for incoming calls (handling room availability inquiries)
@app.route('/incoming-call', methods=['POST'])
def incoming_call():
    response = VoiceResponse()

    # Greet the hotel staff and ask for room availability
    response.say("Hello, please state your request for room availability.")
    response.record(max_length=30, action='/process-recording')
    
    return str(response)

# Route to process recording and analyze with Speech-to-Text
@app.route('/process-recording', methods=['POST'])
def process_recording():
    recording_url = request.form['RecordingUrl']
    transcription = transcribe_audio(recording_url)
    
    # Use GPT to understand the transcription
    ai_response = get_ai_response(transcription)
    
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say(ai_response)  # Respond with AI's answer to room availability
    response.hangup()
    
    return str(response)

# Function to transcribe audio using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
def transcribe_audio(recording_url):
    audio_content = client.api.v2010.accounts(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID).calls(recording_url).fetch().media
    audio_data = BytesIO(audio_content)

    # Use Google Speech-to-Text for transcription
    audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=audio_data.read())
    config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
        encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
        sample_rate_hertz=16000,
        language_code='en-IN',  # Indian English
    )
    
    response = speech_client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)
    transcription = response.results[0].alternatives[0].transcript
    
    return transcription

# Function to send the transcription to OpenAI and get AI's response
def get_ai_response(transcription):
    prompt = f"Hotel Staff said: {transcription}. What is the room availability?"
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Route to initiate follow-up call for post-check-in/check-out
@app.route('/follow-up-call', methods=['POST'])
def follow_up_call():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Hello, we hope you had a pleasant stay. Please rate your experience.")
    response.record(max_length=30, action='/process-feedback')
    
    return str(response)

# Route to process feedback recording
@app.route('/process-feedback', methods=['POST'])
def process_feedback():
    recording_url = request.form['RecordingUrl']
    feedback_transcription = transcribe_audio(recording_url)
    
    # Send feedback transcription to the system (store, process, etc.)
    store_feedback(feedback_transcription)
    
    response = VoiceResponse()
    response.say("Thank you for your feedback. Goodbye!")
    response.hangup()
    
    return str(response)

# Function to store feedback (could be in a database)
def store_feedback(feedback):
    print(f"Feedback Received: {feedback}")
    # You can add logic to store the feedback in a database
    
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

2. Explanation:

    Twilio Integration: Manages calls using Twilio. When a call is received, it asks the hotel staff to provide information on room availability.
    Speech-to-Text: The recorded audio is sent to Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text API for transcription.
    AI Understanding: The transcribed text is sent to GPT via OpenAI’s API to extract the required information, like room availability.
    Follow-up Calls: The bot makes follow-up calls for post-check-in or check-out feedback, using similar logic.
    Handling Responses: The bot can analyze and respond based on various parameters (room availability, customer feedback, etc.).

Step 3: Deployment & Scalability

    Deploying the App:
        Use Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud to deploy the Flask app for scalable operations.
    Ensure Compliance:
        Check that the app complies with Indian telecommunication regulations (e.g., DND lists, caller ID masking).
    Error Handling:
        Add more sophisticated error handling for missed calls, unresponsive hotel staff, and failed transcriptions.
    Performance Scaling:
        Consider using Celery with Redis for handling concurrent calls and background tasks for scalability.

Conclusion

This Python-based solution integrates AI Voicebot functionality with Twilio, Speech-to-Text, and OpenAI’s GPT to automate hotel room availability checks and follow-up processes. It uses advanced NLP for real-time language processing and integrates with existing systems via APIs. The scalable architecture ensures reliable performance for multiple concurrent calls, while compliance with Indian regulations is maintained.
